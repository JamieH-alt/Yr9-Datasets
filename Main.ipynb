    "### Key Details\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data: \\\n",
    " = I am using Open Meteo's data API to look at the temperature over the course of a year. (If possible) \n",
    "* Goal: \\\n",
    " = To identify the coldest days and warmest days to see when seasons mainly pick up (As they have a bit of overlap, e.g. Summer starts cold, Winter starts warm) \n",
    "* Source: \\\n",
    " = https://open-meteo.com/en/\n",
    "* Access: \\\n",
    " = Public as long as you know how to use an API.\n",
    "* Access Method: \\\n",
    " = Via its online API service.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "* Loading \\\n",
    " = The API needs to let me obtain large amounts of data as I'm attempting to look at the weather of a year period. And it all needs to be formatted correctly so it loads easily into pandas.\n",
    "* Data Cleaning \\\n",
    " = The system shouldn't need any data cleaning as it appears to be well maintained\n",
    "* Data Analysis \\\n",
    " = The system needs to allow for mean averaging (And potentially linear regression if I have the time.)\n",
    "* Data Visualisation \\\n",
    " = The data visualisation has not yet been finalised but it will most likely be through Matplotlib or some other similar aplication.\n",
    "* Data Reporting \\\n",
    " = The system should output the charts to the screen and it shouldn't need to store anything as a TXT unless needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " ### Use Cases\n",
    "* Loading \\\n",
    "--  Actor: User \\\n",
    "--  Goal: To choose which dataset to load into the system \\\n",
    "--  Preconditions: User knows the format in which this needs to be inputed (Name of place) \\\n",
    "--  Main Flow: \\\n",
    "------  1. User inputs the location into the right spot in the User interface. \\\n",
    "------  2. User inputs a valid year into the right spot in the User interface. \\\n",
    "------  3. System validates the link. \\\n",
    "------  4. System loads the dataset and proccesses into a chart. \\\n",
    "--  Postconditions: Dataset is loaded and shown to the user as a chart.\n",
    "* Data Reporting \\\n",
    "--  Actor: User \\\n",
    "--  Goal: To decide whether or not to save a file, and to name that file. \\\n",
    "--  Preconditions: User has already loaded an data using an API call from the `Loading` Section \\\n",
    "--  Main Flow: \\\n",
    "------  1. User inputs a file name into the selection box \\\n",
    "------  2. User hits save. \\\n",
    "--  Postconditions: Dataset is saved as a file with the name input by the User.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "* Usability: \\\n",
    " = The Userinterface needs to be non-eyehurting (aestheticly pleasing), easy to navigate and shouldn't require any thought to use. \\\n",
    " = The README document should supply an example of the program being used aswell as a link to the documentation of the Open Meteo API.\n",
    "* Reliability: \\\n",
    " = Little is required from the system when it comes to errors. Mainly just telling the user when a link is incorrect or when an internal error has occured. Thanks to users not having any access to actually interact with the data beyond looking at it; data integrity is a non-issue. \\\n",
    " = Data Accuracy is a requirement especially if I get into linear regression. But also the program should output the difference between the mean of the months and the median to compare those datapoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Researching And Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research of Chosen Issue\n",
    "* Purpose: \\\n",
    " = The key purpose of my project is to identify the days of each month when the temperature changes to match the season; this is important as it helps meteorologists predict how much rain the next winter might bring, how far sea levels will rise due to warmer sea temperatures. Aswell as for the average joe letting them understand what sort of temperature extremities are forecasted.\n",
    "* Missing Data: \\\n",
    " = Currently there isn't an easy way to compare trends in weather between locations and times. Allowing for any thing\n",
    "* Stakeholders: \\\n",
    " = Like previously stated indivduals and meteorologists will benefit from the information I create. Less so meteorologists as I'd imagine they already have the tools to process this data to a higher level than I can, but the resource is still open for them. The information I get from the data analysis is important for an individual to understand what's happening to our climate.\n",
    "* Use: \\\n",
    " = The stakeholders are able to use the information I create to gain a better understanding of our climate and how its changing aswell as giving them the information needed to prepare themselves for upcoming changes in temperature by following trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Privacy And Security\n",
    "* Application Data Privacy: \\\n",
    " = My application does not collect any data from the user. And everything searched is stored on the users computer. The closest to identifiable data that the program requires is a city that the user inputs to pull the data from. There are also zero foreseeable changes/responsibilites that I'd need to make if I was to push this application to the public.\n",
    "* Cyber Security: \\\n",
    " = A normal application should have many things in order to maintain the security of its users. It should have User Authentication, Password Hashing and Encryption to keep all personally identifiable details of the user safe. \\\n",
    " = User Authentication is the process in which a persons identified is verified before they are allowed access to an online service.\n",
    " = Password Hashing is where passwords are changed mathematically before being stored. There's no way to reverse the process and the code for it is stored on the users application. When User Authentication occurs it checks a hashed password against the hashed password saved in the server; allowing a process in which the password itself is never sent across the internet. \\\n",
    " = Encryption is a way to scramble/change/mix data so that only authorised parties with an \"Encryption Key\" can unscramble and read it.\n",
