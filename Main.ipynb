    "### Key Details\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data: \\\n",
    " = I am using Open Meteo's data API to look at the temperature over the course of a year. (If possible) \n",
    "* Goal: \\\n",
    " = To identify the coldest days and warmest days to see when seasons mainly pick up (As they have a bit of overlap, e.g. Summer starts cold, Winter starts warm) \n",
    "* Source: \\\n",
    " = https://open-meteo.com/en/\n",
    "* Access: \\\n",
    " = Public as long as you know how to use an API.\n",
    "* Access Method: \\\n",
    " = Via its online API service.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional Requirements\n",
    "* Loading \\\n",
    " = The API needs to let me obtain large amounts of data as I'm attempting to look at the weather of a year period. And it all needs to be formatted correctly so it loads easily into pandas.\n",
    "* Data Cleaning \\\n",
    " = The system shouldn't need any data cleaning as it appears to be well maintained\n",
    "* Data Analysis \\\n",
    " = The system needs to allow for mean averaging (And potentially linear regression if I have the time.)\n",
    "* Data Visualisation \\\n",
    " = The data visualisation has not yet been finalised but it will most likely be through Matplotlib or some other similar aplication.\n",
    "* Data Reporting \\\n",
    " = The system should output the charts to the screen and it shouldn't need to store anything as a TXT unless needed.\n",

    " ### Use Cases\n",
    "* Loading \\\n",
    "--  Actor: User \\\n",
    "--  Goal: To choose which dataset to load into the system \\\n",
    "--  Preconditions: User knows the format in which this needs to be inputed (Name of place) \\\n",
    "--  Main Flow: \\\n",
    "------  1. User inputs the location into the right spot in the User interface. \\\n",
    "------  2. System validates the link. \\\n",
    "------  3. System loads the dataset and proccesses into a chart. \\\n",
    "--  Postconditions: Dataset is loaded and shown to the user as a chart.\n",
    "* Data Reporting \\\n",
    "--  Actor: User \\\n",
    "--  Goal: To decide whether or not to save a file, and to name that file. \\\n",
    "--  Preconditions: User has already loaded an data using an API call from the `Loading` Section \\\n",
    "--  Main Flow: \\\n",
    "------  1. User inputs a file name into the selection box \\\n",
    "------  2. User hits save. \\\n",
    "--  Postconditions: Dataset is saved as a file with the name input by the User.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Functional Requirements\n",
    "* Usability: \\\n",
    " = The Userinterface needs to be non-eyehurting (aestheticly pleasing), easy to navigate and shouldn't require any thought to use. \\\n",
    " = The README document should supply an example of the program being used aswell as a link to the documentation of the Open Meteo API.\n",
    "* Reliability: \\\n",
    " = Little is required from the system when it comes to errors. Mainly just telling the user when a link is incorrect or when an internal error has occured. Thanks to users not having any access to actually interact with the data beyond looking at it; data integrity is a non-issue. \\\n",
    " = Data Accuracy is a requirement especially if I get into linear regression. But also the program should output the difference between the mean of the months and the median to compare those datapoints.\n",
